# Expense Tracker

## Overview
One of the fun projects I built through the Udemy course React - The Complete Guide. The project allows the user to enter new expenses via a form which are then submitted and appended to the existing expenses list. The list is filtered by year and can be changed at any time. The expense data is then nicely visualized in a bar graph and changes dynamically depending on the selected year. 

## Technologies
HTML, CSS, JavaSript, React
